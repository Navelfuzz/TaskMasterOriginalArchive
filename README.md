## Description

This is an application which will evolve over time as a "To Do List" program that uses different 
data storage and hosting methods and adds components and functionality over time.

### Instructions

In order to run the application, you must run it through an Android Emulator. 
It was constructed using a Pixel 3a XL emulator with a minimum android API 24 and target of 33.

***Lab 32: Espresso Tests Additional Instructions:***
To run tests (and view them running), run emulator within Android Studio. All Test `.java` files are located: `app/src/androidTest/java/com/navelfuzz/taskmaster/*` 

Or

Use the `.gradlew/*` CLI command

## Change Log

### Class 32: Amplify AWS

### Class 31: Testing Views with Espresso

1. Espresso Testing
   * Add more Espresso UI tests to your application, if you haven’t already. Make sure you do at least these three tests:
     * assert that important UI elements are displayed on the page
     * tap on a task, and assert that the resulting activity displays the name of that task
     * edit the user’s username, and assert that it says the correct thing on the homepage

   ***Special Note:***
   * I had to add the following to the build.gradle file in order to get the tests to run:
    ```    
    implementation "androidx.tracing:tracing:1.1.0"
    ```
   * Additionally in my MainAcivityTest2 I had to adjust the 105 line and comment out the `pressBack();` in order to stop the 
   test from closing the application and failing. I am not sure why this is happening, but I will look into it further.

    #### Test Purposes
   1. UserNameTest - Tests that the username is displayed on the homepage
   2. MainActivityTest - Tests that both MainActivity buttons navigate to their corresponding pages
   3. MainActivityTest2 - Tests that adding a task and clicking on that task in the RecyclerView navigates to that task's details page

2. Built APK
   * Did not do this for the Class 27 lab but did for this one as said in the Lab 27 lecture it would be required for this weeks labs for points.

### Class 29: Room 

1. Task Model and Room
   * Following the directions provided in the Android documentation, set up Room in your application, and modify your Task class to be an Entity.
2. Add Task Form
   * Modify your Add Task form to save the data entered in as a Task in your local database.
3. Homepage
   * Refactor your homepage’s RecyclerView to display all Task entities in your database.
4. Detail Page
   * Ensure that the description and status of a tapped task are also displayed on the detail page, in addition to the title. (Note that you can accomplish this by passing along the entire Task entity, or by passing along only its ID in the intent.)

### Class 28: RecyclerViews

1. Task Model
   * Create a Task class. A task should have:
        * Title
        * Body
        * State (new, assigned, in progress, complete)
2. Homepage
   * Refactor the homepage to use a RecyclerView for displaying Task data (hardcoded task data for now)
   * Some Steps
     * Create a ViewAdapter class that displays data from a list of Tasks.
     * In your MainActivity, create at least three hardcoded Task instances and use those to populate your RecyclerView/ViewAdapter.
   * Ensure that you can tap on any one of the Tasks in the RecyclerView and it will appropriately launch the detail page with the correct Task title displayed.


### Class 27: Adding Data Lab
1. Task Details Page
   * Show the selected task's title
   * Lorem Ipsum that description
2. Settings Page
   * Inpute field for Username
   * save button to save the Username
3. Homepage
   * Add Username Label which starts as empty
   * Navigate to the Settings Page via button ***if the user saves their username, display it when we come back to the homepage***
   * Add 3 buttons with "task" titles (hardcoded task titles)
      * Navigate to Task Details Page send the task title
         * Title at top of page should match task selected


### Class: 26 TaskMaster Initial
1. Homepage
    * Title
    * Placeholder Img
    * Button::nav to All Tasks Page
    * Button::nav to Add Task Page
2. Add Task Page

   * Input field for task description
   * Add task button
