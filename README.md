## Description

This is an application which will evolve over time as a "To Do List" program that uses different 
data storage and hosting methods and adds components and functionality over time.

### Instructions

In order to run the application, you must run it through an Android Emulator. 
It was constructed using a Pixel 3a XL emulator with a minimum android API 24 and target of 33.

## Change Log

### Class 29: Room 

1. Task Model and Room
   * Following the directions provided in the Android documentation, set up Room in your application, and modify your Task class to be an Entity.
2. Add Task Form
    * Modify your Add Task form to save the data entered in as a Task in your local database.
3. Homepage
    * Refactor your homepageâ€™s RecyclerView to display all Task entities in your database.
4. Detail Page
    * Ensure that the description and status of a tapped task are also displayed on the detail page, in addition to the title. (Note that you can accomplish this by passing along the entire Task entity, or by passing along only its ID in the intent.)

#### Class 28: RecyclerViews

1. Task Model
   * Create a Task class. A task should have:
        * Title
        * Body
        * State (new, assigned, in progress, complete)
2. Homepage
   * Refactor the homepage to use a RecyclerView for displaying Task data (hardcoded task data for now)
   * Some Steps
     * Create a ViewAdapter class that displays data from a list of Tasks.
     * In your MainActivity, create at least three hardcoded Task instances and use those to populate your RecyclerView/ViewAdapter.
   * Ensure that you can tap on any one of the Tasks in the RecyclerView and it will appropriately launch the detail page with the correct Task title displayed.


#### Class 27: Adding Data Lab
1. Task Details Page
   * Show the selected task's title
   * Lorem Ipsum that description
2. Settings Page
   * Inpute field for Username
   * save button to save the Username
3. Homepage
   * Add Username Label which starts as empty
   * Navigate to the Settings Page via button ***if the user saves their username, display it when we come back to the homepage***
   * Add 3 buttons with "task" titles (hardcoded task titles)
      * Navigate to Task Details Page send the task title
         * Title at top of page should match task selected

1. Homepage
    * Title
    * Placeholder Img
    * Button::nav to All Tasks Page
    * Button::nav to Add Task Page
